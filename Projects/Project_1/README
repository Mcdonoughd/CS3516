HTTP CLIENT & HTTP SERVER
By Daniel McDonough (dmcdonough) 9/11

To run the client, first open the command prompt and navigate to the proper directory, where http_client.cpp and
http_server.cpp are located. To begin either run the command: make


----

To run an instance of the client, run the following command:

.\http_client.c [-p] URL/IP PORT

The -p flag is optional, and will result in the RTT being printed after the GET request is made.
The URL/IP portion, can be any URL OR IP of any website of your choosing.
The PORT, should always be 80 if you are trying to receive a webpage from outside of the host machine.

Output:

The HTTP response header provided by the server is printed to the terminal.
If the URL/IP was given a path/file extension, then the resulting webpage will be printed into a file named the same as the path/file extension in the same directory.
Otherwise, the result will be printed into index.html within the same directory.
And if given the option the RTT will be printed out!

Example Output: (./http_client -p pokemon.com 80)

----

To run the server together on the same machine, open the command prompt in the same way as above. First
run an instance of the server by running the following command:

.\http_server.c PORT

The only parameter for this command is the port which will be used by the server and client to communicate. The port
value should be the same for both the server and the client, otherwise they will not be able to exchange information.
Once you run the server, it will provide information on the IP address of the host machine, which you will need to
input as one of the parameters for the client.

The IP and port will vary depending on your machine and what you passed as the port for the server. To connect the client
to the now running server, you should run the following command:

.\http_client.c [--p] XXX.XXX.XX.X PORT

Replace the XXX.XXX.XX.X with the IP that was given by the server and PORT with the port that the server is running on.


Notes:
  When running the server remember to put the server files in the root directory or from the client look for URL/Serverfiles/somefile
