Reliable	Data	Transfer	Protocol	Simulation
By Daniel McDonough (dmcdonough) 9/27

Note: this program does not account for Out of Order as of 10/4


To run the simulation, first open the command prompt and navigate to the proper directory, where project2.c and
student2.c are located. To begin either run the command: make


----

To run an instance of the client, run the following command:

.\project2 or .\a.out

The program will give the following prompts:

-----  Network Simulator Version    2.3 --------

Enter the number of messages to simulate:
Packet loss probability [enter number between 0.0 and 1.0]:
Packet corruption probability [0.0 for no corruption]:
Packet out-of-order probability [0.0 for no out-of-order]:
Average time between messages from sender's layer5 [ > 0.0]:
Enter Level of tracing desired:
Do you want actions randomized: (1 = yes, 0 = no)?
Do you want Bidirectional: (1 = yes, 0 = no)?

Number of messages to simulate:
The program will stop as soon as this number of messages have been passed
down from layer 5, regardless of whether or not all of the messages have been correctly
delivered. Thus, you need not worry about undelivered or unACK'ed messages still in your
sender when the emulator stops. Note that if you set this value to 1, the program will terminate
immediately, before the message is delivered to the other side. Thus, this value should always be
greater than 1.

Loss:
You are asked to specify a packet loss probability. A value of 0.1 would mean that one in ten
packets (on average) are lost and not delivered to the destination.

Corruption:
You are asked to specify a packet loss probability. A value of 0.2 would mean that two in ten
packets (on average) are corrupted. Note that the contents of payload, sequence, ack, or
checksum fields can be corrupted. Your checksum should thus include the data, sequence, and
ack fields.

Out Of Order:
You are asked to specify an out-of-order probability. A value of 0.2 would mean that two in ten
packets (on average) are reordered.

Tracing:
Setting a tracing value of 1 or 2 will print out useful information about what is going on inside the
emulation (e.g., what's happening to packets and timers). A tracing value of 0 will turn this off. A
tracing value of 5 will display all sorts of odd messages that are for emulator-debugging
purposes. A tracing value of 2 may be helpful to you in debugging your code. You should keep in
mind that real implementers do not have underlying networks that provide such nice information
about what is going to happen to their packets! You will certainly find tracing your own code is
helpful. When the time comes to show off your code, you must have a way of turning off all your
debugging messages. (We will be running with tracing = 1, so you can set your messages to be
displayed only for a higher tracing level â€“ like 3 or 4.
Average time between messages from sender's layer5:
You can set this value to any non-zero, positive value. Note that the smaller the value you choose, the faster packets will be arriving to your sender.

Randomization:
The simulation works by using a random number generator to determine if packets will or will not
be modified in some fashion. Setting 0 here (no randomization) means that you will get the same
result for each of your runs. This can be extremely valuable for debugging. However, for real
testing, you must run with randomization = 1 to see what problems you can shake out. When you
demonstrate your code, I expect to see randomization enabled.

Direction:
The possibilities are Unidirectional = 0, Bidirectional = 1 (Which is not implemented).

Sample Output:

-----  Network Simulator Version    2.3 --------

Enter the number of messages to simulate: 100

Average time between messages from sender's layer5 [ > 0.0]: 1
Enter Level of tracing desired: 1
Do you want actions randomized: (1 = yes, 0 = no)? 1
Do you want Bidirectional: (1 = yes, 0 = no)? 0
